[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/examples-in-heat-transfer&file=START_HERE.mlx)

This repository shows examples of using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)®, [Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html)™, and [Partial Differential Equation Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/pde.html)™ for solving canonical problems in Heat Transfer.

# Setup 

Each example have their own folder, and can be copied and used individually. Open the folder and run the main live script, or use the links below.
